This project creates a family tree that depends on two files. One being
familyinfo.txt and familytree.txt.

familytree.txt contains data that is used to construct a tree object. Given
is a sample tree from yours truly. If you would like to create your own tree
here are the steps:
1: To create a root, type a name followed by the number of children
2: If the root has a child, create new line and type in a new name, followed
   by a number. Then enter new line. Feel free to indent to better understand
   the tree, the program ignores the spaces/tabs.
3: If the root has multiple childs, create new line and after each name and number,
   create a new line.
4: To represent multiple levels (grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc...) simply
   follow the same steps from above. (Spaces and Tabs are not only allowed but highly
   recommended. Use them so as not to get confused!!!)

familyinfo.txt this text file is really optional, but it makes the program look less
boring, so let your creativity run wild!
familyinfo.txt holds all the data for each person in the tree, if you don't want to
create data for each person then you don't have to. But if you would like to create 
data for a person then you must follow these formatting steps

Line 1: Name of person
Line 2: Date of birth
Line 3: Place of birth
Line 4: Spouse
Line 5: Description (when entering new line for description, add a space before 
	continuing.
End of description: When your description is done, enter a new line from the end of the
sentence and type "End"

Thats it! If you want to omit certain data fields, feel free to leave it blank, or type 
N/A.
